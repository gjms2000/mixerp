###Configuration Explained

| Key                         | Configuration |
|-----------------------------| -------------|
| Server                      | The hostname or IP address of your development PostgreSQL Server instance. Usually "localhost". |
| Port                        | The port on which the PostgreSQL server is listening. Usually "5432". |
| Database                    | The default MixERP database. |
| UserId                      | MixERP database script will create a user mix_erp. Leave it as it is unless you are sure what you are doing. |
| Password                    | Password for the above user. The default password is "change-on-deployment". If you happen to change the password, change it here as well. |
| Catalogs                    | Comma separated list of MixERP databases including the default database. These databases will be shown on the ***sign in page***. |
| MetaCatalog                 | The **master database** which contains multi-company meta information. |
| ReportUserId                | MixERP database script will create a user report_user. This user **must have a read-only access to the database**.|
| ReportUserPassword          | Password for the above user. The default password is "change-on-deployment". If you happen to change the password, change it here as well. |
| AutoBackupEveryNMinutes     | By default, MixERP performs automated backups every 12 hours or 720 minutes. |
| PostgreSQLBinDirectory      | Depending upon where you installed PostgreSQL server, enter the correct location of the bin directory. |
| DatabaseBackupDirectory     | Enter the path where you want to keep your database backups. If you host MixERP on IIS, make sure that the ApplicationPoolIdentity/IIS user has write access to the path. |
